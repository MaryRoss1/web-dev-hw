# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Depo
## Mary Ross
I decided to take this class because I think web design is a useful skill, as is a foundation of knowledge for coding.

But what really is the internet? I found it interesting that:
* The internet is a result of Arpanet, efforts to build a communication that would be distributed rather than centralized
* The internet is the most quickly adopted form of communication in our species history
* A basic unit for global cables connecting us is 10 GBs per second
