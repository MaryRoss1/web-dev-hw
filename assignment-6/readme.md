<h1> Read Me: Assignment-6 </h1>

<p>I chose the 60's solely because I liked the looks of the graphics provided for that decade.
I chose a color scheme that somewhat matched the color in the graphics. I added circles because there was already a circular pattern in the graphic.
For the background, I used the color rgb(255, 214, 128) after I messed around with the numbers a little on a color generator.
Then I chose a yellow similar to the one in the graphic using #FFD700
Finally, a white for the circles for some contrast using #F8F8FF
</p>
The main issues I had during this assignment were 1: a lack of time due to two exams and two papers and 2: small coding error that are hard to see such as  "-" instead of "="
