<h1> Assignment 7 </h1>

I chose fonts and colors based on a poster advertising the Maltese Falcon movie. I wish I could have made it look more vintage, but tried to pick fonts and colors that reflected this poster

System fonts are fonts that are already installed
Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server
Web-Safe Fonts are fonts that both Windows OS and Mac OS can see.

Fallback fonts are fonts that the site will use if the primary font will not load.

I like the freedom in CSS to add design elements to the sight. If I wasn't in the middle of the busiest two weeks of the semester, I would play around with it some more. I found this material simple as it uses a lot of the things learned in Assignment 6.

Here is a photo of the poster I based my site on:
