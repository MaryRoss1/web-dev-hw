  <h1> About the Project </h1>
    <p> Knot tying is an important aspect of rock climbing and ice climbing, two activities I enjoy doing. The overhand knot is the most simple, and most people have used before without knowing the technical term. </p>

    <h4>Learning More About Knots</h4>
    <p> If you are planning to do any type of top rope or lead climbing, a knowledge of knots is essential. The internet has endless amounts of resources when it comes to learning knots. I find that it is important to take what you learn to a climbing gym first, where someone can help you tweak your knots and which knots are best.

      <h2> About Myself </h2>
<p> I am a fifth year student at UM and I'm originally from El Paso, Texas. I was outside a lot growing up, but it wasn't until moving to Missoula that I started to consider climbing, only to find out some of the best climbing is surrounding El Paso. It has been cool to be able to climb in two different landscapes and in two different homes. </p>
