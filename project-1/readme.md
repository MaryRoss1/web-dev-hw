A browser is a program that allows users to send a request for something that you wish to view, the browser collects web content and displays a page for you.

I went to the year 1995, viewing a snapshot of internet explorer. The image reminds me of playing minesweeper when I was younger. I would say the most notable changes to me are the improved graphics, the addition of things like youtube, and the overall complexity and artistry that goes into websites today.

This project had me running in circles a little bit. In the midst of a busy week, I started the project late and I skipped through some of the elements on the learning website which only made things harder and slower. I had some trouble figuring out how to view the index.html in browser but once I reviewed the material it all made sense... kind of.
